# FactNews: Consensus-Driven News Verification System

FactNews is an advanced analytical platform designed to cross-verify news information across multiple global media outlets. By employing a council of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system identifies consensus, highlights contested facts, and provides a transparent overview of current events based on verifiable evidence.

## Core Philosophy

The primary objective of FactNews is to mitigate the impact of misinformation and media bias. The system operates on three fundamental pillars:

1. **Multi-Source Verification**: No single source is treated as the definitive truth. Information is aggregated from a diverse range of international media.
2. **Consensus Identification**: The system mathematically and semantically calculates the degree of agreement between different reports on the same event.
3. **Transparent Sourcing**: Every claim generated by the system is explicitly linked to its original source, allowing users to verify the evidence independently.

## Key Features

### Automated Multi-Source Ingestion

The backend features an automated ingestion engine that monitors over 20 major news outlets via RSS feeds. It captures headlines, metadata, and full article content, providing a robust dataset for analysis.

### Intelligent Story Clustering

Incoming articles are processed using sophisticated clustering algorithms. This ensures that different reports covering the same event are grouped together, facilitating a comprehensive comparison of various perspectives and details.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

By utilizing vector databases (Supabase pgvector) and semantic search, the system retrieves the most relevant context for any user query. This context is then processed by the LLM council to generate highly accurate and grounded responses.

### Bias and Divergence Analysis

Beyond simple fact-checking, FactNews analyzes the nuances in reporting. It identifies "divergences"—areas where sources disagree on specific details—and provides a preliminary analysis of potential media bias within the coverage.

## Technical Architecture

The system is built using a modern, scalable stack:

### Backend

- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Processing**: Python-based natural language processing and clustering.
- **Database**: Supabase with pgvector for high-performance semantic search.
- **Models**: Integration with OpenAI (GPT), Anthropic (Claude), and Google (Gemini).

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Next.js (TypeScript)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a responsive and professional interface.
- **Interactions**: Real-time communication with the backend API for dynamic news updates and query processing.

## Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- Git
- Access to OpenAI API or other supported LLM providers

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following parameters:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your provider API key.
   - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL.
   - `SUPABASE_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key.
5. Initialize the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The backend API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Development Roadmap

The project is structured into several phases of increasing complexity:

- **Phase 1**: Initial MVP with core backend architecture and basic frontend.
- **Phase 2**: Integration of single-model LLM and initial embeddings. (In Progress)
- **Phase 3**: Automated RSS ingestion and full article scraping. (In Progress)
- **Phase 4**: Migration to vector database (Supabase pgvector).
- **Phase 5**: Implementation of the Multi-LLM consensus council.
- **Phase 6**: Advanced UI for visualizing consensus and divergence metrics.
